### 🎯General Objective:

- Become familiar with using GitHub Copilot to create automated workflows in GitHub Actions:
- Automate the development and deployment lifecycle of a Next.js application using GitHub Actions

### Specific Objectives:

- Set up the Node.js environment using GitHub Actions
- Run automated tests and build the application
- Integrate security actions into the workflow
- Deploy the Next.js application to GitHub Pages
- Optimize and refine the workflow with GitHub Copilot's assistance

### Expected Outcomes:

By the end of the hands-on session, you should have a fully functional CI/CD pipeline that handles everything from dependency installation to deploying the application on GitHub Pages.
Additionally, you will have learned how to leverage GitHub Copilot to accelerate the setup of workflows in GitHub Actions and how to integrate security tools into the process.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository 🚀

### Step 2: Create a New Repository

Create a new repository with the name: gh-action-copilot-handson-demo

Make sure to have read and write permissions in the workflow settings

Configuration


Settings -> Actions -> General -> Workflow Permissions -> Read and Write

### Step 3: Add New Remote to Cloned Repository

Use copilot cli to add a new remote

```
gh copilot suggest "how to add a new remote to github repository"
```

### Step 4: Create a basic workflow template using GitHub Copilot

Ask to copilot Chat

👤 Prompt:
```
@workspace I want to create a basic github workflow called handson that trigger on every push to main branch. I just want the trigger step
```

🤖 Copilot Answer:
```

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
```

### Step 5: Define job in the workflow

    category: "/language:javascript"

```

Reference:

- https://codeql.github.com/
- https://github.com/github/codeql-action/blob/v2/analyze/action.yml

### Step 9: Implement TruffleHog to Find Leaked Credentials

👤 Prompt:
```
@workspace Now, I want to implement a step to find possible leaked credentials, use trufflesecurity/trufflehog with the main version, only-verified as extra_args, head with the current ref name
```

In case that you have some errors with the version use:

```
name: Scan for leaked credentials
uses: trufflesecurity/trufflehog@main
with:
base: ""
head: ${{ github.ref_name }}
extra_args: --only-verified
```

Reference:

- https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog

### Step 10: Add step to run test

Ask to copilot chat or use comment driven development to add another step to run tests


**Copilot chat**:

👤 Prompt:
```
@workspace Add another step to run tests with npm run
```

**Comment driven development\***:

```
Add another step to run tests with npm run
```
🤖 Copilot Answer:
```
- name: Run tests
  run: npm run test
```

### Step 11: Add step to build

**Copilot chat**:

👤 Prompt:
```
Add another step to run the build with npm run
```

**Comment driven development\***:

```
Add another step to run the build with npm run
```

🤖 Copilot Answer:
```
- name: Build
  run: npm run build
```

### Step 12: Test workflow

We are going to test our workflow, pleas commit and push to main branch. Then:

- Go to your repository
- Navigate to "Actions tab"

You will see your workflow running

## Deploy to GitHub Pages with GitHub Actions and Copilot

Before continue with the next steps, please open the 'next.config.mjs' file and edit the fields assetPrefix and base path, change the values of these fields to the repository name(gh-action-copilot-handson)

### Step 1: Add Step to upload out directory with upload artifact action

Ask to copilot chat to add a new step in the current job to upload the out directory using upload artifact action

👤 Prompt:
```
@workspace Now, I want to use the upload artifact action to upload the out directory
```

🤖 Copilot Answer:
```
- name: Upload artifact
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: out-directory
    path: out
```

### Step 2: Create a new job to deploy our app

Ask to copilot chat to create another job called deploy and to add a step to dwonload the previous uploaded artifact

👤 Prompt:
```
@workspace How to create another job called deploy with only a step to download an artifact and the output should be 'out'
```

### Step 3: Add step to deploy to GitHub Pages

Ask to copilot how to deploy to github page

```
Once you have pushed to the main branch and the workflow has finished executing, go to the settings tab -> pages and select Deploy from a branch. Choose the `gh-pages` branch, the `/root` folder, and click save. After a few minutes, your application should be available along with the page URL.

## Create a reusable workflow.

### Step 1: add a reusable workflow

Ask to copilot, to create a reusable workflow for the step deploy to github page

👤 Prompt:
```
@workspace how can I create a reusable workflow for the step Deploy to github page, the reusable workflow must require the publish dir as input. Just give me the reusable workflow
```

🤖 Copilot Answer:
```

  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      publish_dir:
        description: 'The directory to publish to GitHub Pages'
        required: true
        type: string

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ${{ inputs.publish_dir }}
```

### Step 2: Use the reusable workflow

Ask to copilot to rename the deploy job and create another job to use rereusable workflow

```

Should give us an answer like this:

🤖 Copilot Answer:
```
  deploy:
    needs: download-artifact
    uses: ./.github/workflows/deploy.yml
    with:
      publish_dir: ./out
```
